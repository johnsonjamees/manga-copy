'''
This Python script is designed to monitor a specific directory for file changes, particularly focusing on files with a '.cbz' extension, commonly used for comic book archives.
Designed to make Suwayomi-Server and Kavita Work togethe. Might also work for Komga,

General Overview and Operation
Class Definition (MangaHandler): Inherits from FileSystemEventHandler to handle specific file system eventsâ€”file creation and deletion.
Initialization: Accepts root_dir and target_dir specifying the directory to monitor and the target to store processed files, respectively.
Event Handling:
on_created: Triggered when a new file is created. If the file has a '.cbz' extension, it waits until the download is complete using wait_until_download_completes.
on_deleted: Triggered on file deletion. If the file is a '.cbz' file, it proceeds to remove the corresponding file in the target directory through remove_corresponding_file.
File Processing:
wait_until_download_completes: Checks repeatedly (every second) until the file size does not change, indicating the download has completed.
process_file: Changes the filename to include the series name (derived from the directory structure) and creates a hard link in the target directory.
remove_corresponding_file: Removes the hard link from the target directory if the original '.cbz' file is deleted.
